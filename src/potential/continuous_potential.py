    """
    Abstract class for continuous potentials used in the algorithm code.

    A general continuous-potential class provides the function itself, its gradient and the potential difference
        resulting from the displacement of a single particle.

        The constructor of the ContinuousPotential class.

        This class is designed for cooperative inheritance, meaning that it passes through all unused kwargs in the
        init to the next class in the MRO via super.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prefactor : float, optional
            A general multiplicative prefactor of the potential.
        kwargs : Any
            Additional kwargs which are passed to the __init__ method of the next class in the MRO.

        Raises
        ------
        base.exceptions.ConfigurationError
            If prefactor is not greater than 0.0.

        Returns the potential function for the given particle positions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : numpy.ndarray
            A two-dimensional numpy array of size (number_of_particles, dimensionality_of_particle_space); each element
            is a float and represents one Cartesian component of the position of a single particle. For Bayesian
            models, the entire positions array corresponds to the parameter; for the Ginzburg-Landau potential on a
            lattice, the entire positions array corresponds to the entire array of superconducting phase.

        Returns

        float
            The potential function.
