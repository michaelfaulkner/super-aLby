        The constructor of the LennardJonesPotentialWithoutLinkedLists class.

        NOTE THAT:
            i) The Metropolis algorithm does not seem to converge for two Lennard-Jones particles for which the
            value of each component of size_of_particle_space is greater than twice the value of characteristic_length
            -- perhaps due to too much time spent with particles independently drifting around.
            ii) Newtonian- and relativistic-dynamics-based algorithms do not seem to converge for two Lennard-Jones
            particles for which the value of each component of size_of_particle_space is less than twice the value of
            characteristic_length -- perhaps due to discontinuities in the potential gradients.
